##Eric's Sinatra Skeleton

This is a Sinatra skeleton that I wrote to make creating Sinatra apps much more effcient. It includes CRUD functionality for users with authentication, a decent HTML/CSS layout that makes developing more pleasurable and that's about it.

It also includes a touch of Javascript just for fun.

I've found it super useful when popping up a site quickly.     

###To use run:

* ```bundle install```
* ```rake db:create```, will create your database.
* ```rake db:migrate```, will migrate your database.
* ```shotgun```, will start the Sinatra server... and you're good to go!
